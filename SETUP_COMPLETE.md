Your Discord Emoji Bot now has a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using Woodpecker CI. Here's what has been implemented:

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Pipeline Configuration
- `.woodpecker.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `.woodpecker/test.yml` - Quick test pipeline for development
- `.woodpecker/deploy.yml` - Production deployment pipeline
- `.woodpecker/secrets-template.md` - Documentation for required secrets

### Development & Testing
- `test_bot.py` - Basic test suite for the bot
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- `Makefile` - Development automation commands
- `WOODPECKER_CI_README.md` - Comprehensive CI/CD documentation

### Alternative CI (Backup)
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

## 🎯 Pipeline Capabilities

### Main Pipeline (`.woodpecker.yml`)
1. **Lint Stage**: Code formatting, import sorting, style checks
2. **Security Stage**: Vulnerability scanning, static security analysis
3. **Build Stage**: Docker image creation and testing
4. **Test Stage**: Container functionality validation
5. **Package Stage**: Deployment artifact creation
6. **Deploy Stage**: Production deployment (main branch only)
7. **Notify Stage**: Status notifications

### Development Pipeline (`.woodpecker/test.yml`)
- Quick syntax and import validation
- Fast Docker build testing
- Perfect for pull requests and feature branches

### Deployment Pipeline (`.woodpecker/deploy.yml`)
- Pre-deployment environment validation
- Production Docker image builds
- Docker Compose deployment
- Health checks and monitoring
- Cleanup and maintenance

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Configure Secrets in Woodpecker CI

Add these secrets to your repository in Woodpecker CI:

**Required:**
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

**Optional:**
- `GUILD_ID` - Discord server ID for testing
- `RESPONSE_CHANNEL` - Bot response channel name/ID

### 2. Test Locally First

```bash
# Setup development environment
make setup

# Run all CI checks locally
make ci-test

# Build and test Docker image
make ci-build
```

### 3. Push to Repository

The pipeline will automatically trigger on:
- Push to any branch
- Pull requests
- Tagged releases
- Manual execution

### 4. Monitor Pipeline

- Check Woodpecker CI dashboard for pipeline status
- View detailed logs for each stage
- Monitor deployment health checks

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Test Locally**
   ```bash
   make format  # Format code
   make lint    # Run linting
   make test    # Run tests
   ```

3. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

4. **Pipeline Validation**
   - Woodpecker CI runs test pipeline
   - Validates code quality and functionality
   - Provides feedback on any issues

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Review pipeline results
   - Address any failures
   - Merge when approved

6. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Merge to main triggers deploy pipeline
   - Production deployment happens automatically
   - Health checks validate deployment

## 📊 Pipeline Monitoring
